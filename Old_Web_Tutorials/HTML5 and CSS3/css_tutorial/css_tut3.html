	<h2>Here we are going to talk about the &ltdiv&gt and &ltspan&gt tags.</h2> 
	
	<div>
	<p>
	&ltdiv&gt and &ltspan&gt are basically useless in basic HTML, but of great use in CSS, for styling purposes
	</p>

	<br/>
	&ltdiv&gt is used for "larger" blocks, or in other words, it is used to sorround paragraphs and larger parts of pages. 
	<br/>
	&ltspan&gt is used for inline text, for example: to emphasize, or decorate specific words in text.
