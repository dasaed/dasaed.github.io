<header>
A &ltheader&gt tag is important for getting ranked and designing a more descriptive web page. Here you would put something descriptive throughout all your websites, like the logo which should be the same on all the pages. It is good practice to have the &ltnav&gt inside the header. 
<img src="logo.png" alt="a logo is supposed to be here."/>
<nav>
The &ltnav&gt tag is used for adding navigation into the website. for example, for placing the following links:
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Contact</li>
<li>Some other links</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="css_tut1.html">click here</a> to go to the beginning of the CSS tutorials</p></li>
<li><p><a href="css_tut6.html">Click here</a> to go to the previous tutorial</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com">Click here to go to google.com</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="css_tut8.html">This is the link to the next tutorial</a></li>
<li><p>If you want to return to the home page <a href="../index.html">press here</a>
</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h2> This is an article header  </h2>
			<h3> A subheading may go here  </h3>
			<h4> Although a &ltheader&gt is used to emcompass these headers, it is different from the main header, and the browser and search engines understand that. </h4>
			</header>
			<p>Inside of this &ltarticle&gt tag we could add articles, news, blogs or just write our story or whatever content the website is supposed to have.
			</p>
			<p>This wouldn't be an article without some paragraphs thrown in the mix</p>
			<p>This is actually the third paragraph here</p>
			<p>This would be the fourth paragraph here. </p>
			<p>You may also add a &ltfooter&gt tag here</p>
