                <p>I am passionate about technology, sports, education, networking and innovative ideas, and I trust that you will find me to be a great asset for the company.</p>

                <p>Although I may be categorized as just being bilingual, I truly am multicultural. I have lived for half of my life in Colombia and the other half in the United States. I not only see the world from different perspectives, I am also open
                    minded about new opportunities and not afraid of stepping up to new challenges. My experiences in the US, that included being an academic mentor in high school, a member of the business academy, and JV wrestling team captain, have
                    opened doors to working as an English teacher, and have altogether allowed me to acquire skills in problem solving, time management, communication, typing, database management, and Microsoft Office skills.</p>

                <p>My peers consider me a natural leader, as I am never too shy to speak in public, intervene when help was needed, or volunteer to provide effective and mutually beneficial solutions to conflicts when they arose. I was randomly chosen to
                    lead a small team of engineers in charge of the management of clientsâ€™ Unix infrastructure. For example, as a team, we upgraded and patched the servers, proposed plans to optimize resources distribution, implemented scripts to automate
                    processes, and so much more.</p>

                <p>As a person who understands technology, capable of working well in both team-oriented and self-directed projects, organized, determined, with a creative problem-solving mentality, and fluent in English and Spanish (currently learning French),
                    I would welcome an opportunity to meet with you and further discuss my qualifications.</p>

                <p>I trust that my intuitive and innovative approach to problem-solving and solution-finding along with my desire to learn, will prove to be of great benefit. I look forward to hearing from you and, perhaps arrange a personal interview to
                    further discuss with you how I can best serve your company.</p>
